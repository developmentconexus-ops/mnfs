## Program state

```text
M0 — Foundation Walking Skeleton                         ACCEPTED
M1 — Visual Mission Planning                            ACCEPTED
M2 — Secure One-Worker Vertical Slice                   OPPORTUNITY_REPLAN
  MIS-002/M01 — Durable Execution and Lease Core        ACCEPTED
  MIS-002/M02 — Governed E1 Worker, Recovery and Acceptance
                                                        SUPERSEDED_AS_EXECUTION_PATH
```

- **Canonical environment:** Ubuntu on WSL2; Windows remains the browser, terminal and desktop host.
- **Architecture baseline:** accepted historical baseline merged through PR #11; accumulated Evidence, not current solution-space boundary.
- **Approved Mission contract:** `MIS-002` revision 5, schema v2, `sha256:d82252504044cab40e00013dc30534654382887b7819d60a916d2a9a56db4cc3`; immutable historical/current authority until explicitly superseded, but D-015 prohibits implementing its M02 realization.
- **Current governance method:** `DOC-MNFS-DEVELOPMENT-GOVERNANCE-METHOD` / D-010.
- **Architecture Review decisions:** D-011 through D-015 APPROVED.
- **Execution Planning Design:** `DESIGN-LAYERED-AGENT-EXECUTION-PLANNING` 1.0.0 ACCEPTED / D-016.
- **Current phase:** Architecture Reconciliation + Spike Execution Planning under Issue #23.
- **Superseded prior planning container:** Issue #21 — prior `MIS-002/M02` R5 path; do not resume under revision 5.
- **Deferred operational hardening:** Issue #20 — real M01 R2/R3 crash/lineage scenarios.

## Accepted architecture direction

```text
Thin Sovereign Semantic Kernel
+
Validation-first Planning
+
Replaceable Open Agent Runtime
+
Property-based Execution Environment
+
Provider-neutral Git Result Boundary
+
Independent Evidence / Gates
+
Capability-first Sourcing
```

## Accepted execution-planning direction

```text
L0 Validation Baseline   → frozen correctness
L1 Realization Baseline  → frozen approved architecture
L2 Execution Graph       → versioned bounded decomposition
L3 Tactical Agent Plan   → adaptive/ephemeral
```

Fresh Actors receive role-specific compiled packs. Authority, security, environment, write/resource scope and deciding proof are eager; large optional material is progressively disclosed. Every execution unit has finite retry/hypothesis budgets and explicit `SUCCESS`, `BLOCKED`, `ESCALATE`, `HANDOFF_REQUIRED` and `REPLAN_REQUIRED` termination.

## MCRM readiness inherited by M2

```text
R0 Baseline              HISTORICAL PASS — new baseline required after reconciliation
R1 Applicability         HISTORICAL PASS — new applicability scan required
R2 Requirements          HISTORICAL PASS — preserve/revise after architecture selection
R3 Capability Readiness  HISTORICAL PASS — superseding CAP-EXECUTION required
R4 Contract Readiness    HISTORICAL PASS — MIS-002 revision 5 must be superseded before execution
M01 R5 Microdesign       PASS / ACCEPTED / CLOSED
```

Historical results and Evidence remain valid for the exact authority/version they proved. They are not silently relabeled as proof of the new realization.

## M01 final result

```text
CAP-EXECUTION historical spec:         ACCEPTED — version 0.1.0
MIS-002 historical/current contract:   APPROVED — revision 5 / exact hash
M01 microdesign:                       ACCEPTED — version 0.6.1
M01 implementation plan:              APPROVED — version 1.0.1
Tasks 1–14:                            COMPLETE / VERIFIED
M01 closeout:                          ACCEPTED — D-009
M01 lifecycle status:                  ACCEPTED / CLOSED
```

Provider-neutral M01 Evidence remains reusable for durable WriteTrack/Attempt/ActorRun identity, fencing, Claim atomicity, Intent–Action–Observation, Recovery/Reconcile and Git base/result lineage. Treehouse-specific Evidence remains historical realization Evidence and does not mandate future workspace architecture.

## Deciding Architecture Spikes

```text
ARR-S0  Host Capability Probe
ARR-S1  Agent Runtime Conformance
ARR-S2  Local Execution Envelope Conformance
ARR-S2W Workspace comparison — conditional only
ARR-S3  Vertical Composition Proof
```

No concrete Agent Runtime, process sandbox, microVM or workspace substrate has been selected.

## Current authorization boundary

```text
M01 implementation / closeout:             ACCEPTED / CLOSED
D1–D4 + Architecture Synthesis:             APPROVED
Execution Planning Design 1.0.0:            ACCEPTED — D-016
Architecture reconciliation/spike planning: CURRENT / AUTHORIZED
ARR-S0 execution:                           PROHIBITED pending exact Operator gate
ARR-S1/S2/S2W/S3 execution:                 PROHIBITED pending their later exact gates
MIS-002 revision 5 M02 implementation:       PROHIBITED / SUPERSEDED PATH
Production Worker dispatch:                 PROHIBITED
Automatic delivery / merge:                 NOT AUTHORIZED
```

## Immediate next action

Write and review the **Architecture Reconciliation + Spike Execution Plan**.

The plan must:

- reconcile D-011 through D-016 into exact document/authority changes without rewriting accepted history;
- fully specify the first executable tranche and `ARR-S0` with exact files, proof, outputs and failure conditions;
- define candidate-independent contracts and gates for S1/S2/S2W/S3 while deferring implementation details that prior Spike Evidence must decide;
- include mechanical coverage showing every accepted architecture/planning decision has a planned consumer;
- preserve fresh-Actor, proof-first, independent-validation and structured-handoff requirements;
- state explicit authorization boundaries so plan approval does not imply Spike execution.

After the plan is approved, issue a separate exact Operator authorization for ARR-S0 only. Do not execute any Spike before that gate.
