# Runtime and Product Agents

Current technical detail extracted without semantic rewriting from the accepted Phase-3 architecture baseline. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` owns the overview; this file owns the detailed task surface named by its title.

## 24. Production Agent Runtime architecture

## 24.1 Current line

```text
exact active Conexus Release
→ derived RuntimeAgentProjection
→ ParMastra / mastra_par
→ direct Mastra Agent
→ Product AgentRun
```

Runtime projection is derived/rebuildable/cacheable, non-authoritative.

No `RuntimeAgentRevision` business class.

## 24.2 Admission before execution

```text
resolve current admissible surface
→ admit Product AgentRun owner fact
→ pin exact Release/agent/tool/model/runtime facts
→ commit
→ only then model/tool execution
```

## 24.3 Closed override channels

Production never resolves authoritative Agent behavior from:

```text
Mastra Stored Agent latest
Editor mutable config
request-body revision override
runtime “current version”
```

A suspended old run reconstructs from exact old pins.

## 24.4 Conversation/memory

```text
ConversationId = Conexus identity
Mastra threadId = substrate mechanism
```

Baseline:

```text
Conversation/message history = ON when Conversation exists
Working/Agent Memory          = consumer/eval-gated
Semantic Recall               = OFF until admitted/evaluated
Observational Memory          = OFF until admitted/evaluated
Memory Extractors             = OFF until admitted/evaluated
```

Scheduled Agent runs are threadless by default.

Memory resource scope includes Workspace + Project + Agent + memory class/purpose + subject where applicable.

## 24.5 Suspension/resume

For durable waits:

```text
PAR owner persists exact proposal/ApprovalRequest first
→ owner commit
→ native Mastra requireApproval provides mechanical suspension/checkpoint in mastra_par
→ process may disappear
→ resume rebuilds exact old projection
→ current authorization/owner facts rechecked
→ raw RequestContext remains non-authoritative runtime substrate
→ governed tool/effect boundary rechecks current owner truth
→ resume exact same AgentRun
```

Owner wait without runtime snapshot is a recoverable failure case. Runtime snapshot without owner authority is structurally unacceptable.

## 24.6 Exact proposal identity

Resume re-presents exact:

```text
proposalRef + args
```

Mismatch to the sealed subject fails closed. Mastra `toolCallId` is correlation only.

## 24.7 Product-Agent `SCHEDULE`

Product-Agent recurrence is PAR-owned and distinct from MAR managed-sync catch-up:

```text
schedule wake
→ guarded PAR schedule-fire ingress
→ validate current trigger/revision/schedule
→ stable intended-slot identity before AgentRun admission
→ consume cursor scoped by (TriggerId, TriggerRevision)
→ enforce single-flight
→ resolve/pin exact current Release
→ admit AgentRun
```

```text
valid occurrence + active trigger-origin AgentRun
→ consume occurrence as SKIPPED
→ no AgentRun
→ no hidden backlog/catch-up
```

Schedule fire never executes the Product Agent directly. Exact transport remains Package-B proof.

## 25. Builder ↔ Production Agent Runtime isolation

## 25.1 Role-specific Mastra

```text
Builder role
├── BuilderMastra
├── mastra_builder
├── Builder-local PubSub/runtime namespace
└── Builder-only AgentController/tools/Workspaces

PAR role
├── ParMastra
├── mastra_par
├── PAR-local PubSub/runtime namespace
└── PAR-only Agents/tools/schedules/memory
```

Forbidden sharing:

```text
same mutable Mastra store
same same-process PubSub instance
same external PubSub namespace/keyPrefix
same Agent object instance
same mutable Memory instance
Builder Workspace/toolset in PAR
standalone/ephemeral fallback for governed runs
```

## 25.2 Same-process baseline is conditional

Builder and PAR may coexist in one Hub application process only if Package B proves the enabled F1 mutable surfaces can be partitioned/fenced.

Material unpartitionable cross-role framework global state fires the process-split trigger; semantic owners do not change.

## 25.3 RequestContext

Mastra RequestContext is runtime/configuration/correlation substrate, not Product/business authority.

Every dispatch/rebind/resume supplies the complete current request/runtime configuration required by early Agent shaping:

```text
current/pinned owner facts
→ build NEW role-specific RequestContext
→ Mastra continuation mechanics may retain subordinate runtime keys
→ governed owner/tool/Gateway decision rechecks current Conexus owner truth
→ fail closed on stale/revoked/mismatched authority before effect admission
```

Raw or restored `RequestContext`, Mastra approval state, `toolCallId` and model output never become permission, role, binding, approval or effect authority. Physical survival of an unknown stale key is not itself a failure; its use as current authority is prohibited.

## 25.4 Status

```text
architecture = CURRENT
3L-R1 framework-native rebaseline = APPROVED / CURRENT
Package B B0 = EXECUTION COMPLETE / LEAD-ADJUDICATED / PASS
Package B proof-routing amendment = APPROVED / CURRENT
Package B BT-1 = PASS

3L = CLOSED / 3L-R3 FINAL CLOSURE
3M = NEXT / NOT STARTED
Product implementation = BLOCKED
C-018 = NOT RATIFIED
```

Same-process qualification is accepted only for the currently enabled F1 Mastra surfaces. Disabled scorer/evaluation, DurableAgent and Observational Memory globals remain deferred and require requalification before enablement.

## 26. Product Agent authoring architecture

Agent authoring is a specialized Builder experience over Project authority:

```text
structured/manual edit
OR
natural-language Conexus edit
→ same Change
→ same candidate agent/v1
→ same Plan/diff/work graph
→ same proof/checkpoint
→ immutable ArtifactRevision
→ same Release
```

No `AgentBuilderModule`, second Agent DB or Mastra Editor authority.

ToolProjection compiles exact admitted owner resources such as:

```text
Project Query
Project Action
Integration Operation
explicit platform-native tool with real consumer
```

AnalyticQuery remains an admitted Brain read regime, but it is **not** an automatic Product-Agent ToolProjection source. A named current consumer plus exact Release/tool authority must explicitly admit that use.

No `execute(anySlug, anyInput)` capability primitive is exposed to the model.

Missing dependency can be proposed by Builder, but must become explicit Change scope and pass applicable effect/access/Release gates.

## 29. F5 owner-control handoff

Runtime has two semantically different outbound paths:

```text
A. owner-control F5 proposal
B. Operational Telemetry observation
```

Never reconstruct owner control truth from telemetry.

## 29.1 In-process

```text
runtime
→ narrow typed callback/function bound to owner dispatch context
→ owner validates current facts
→ owner writes owner transition
```

Producer-supplied run ID = cross-check only. Effective target identity comes from the owner dispatch closure/opaque handle.

```text
owner dispatch target identity != producer payload identity
→ refuse proposal
→ diagnostic/Finding as applicable
-X-> terminalize or mutate another run
```

## 29.2 Duplicate/lost response

Owner terminal/output transitions are current-guarded/write-once where required; duplicate callback cannot manufacture a second conflicting terminal fact.

Transport acknowledgement != domain application.

## 29.3 Future process split

If runtime later moves out of process, narrow authenticated RPC may preserve the same owner semantics.

No generic RuntimeBus/EventBus/UniversalRuntimeEnvelope for optionality.

---

## 45. Recovery invariants carried into 3M

R11-D does not solve 3M. Current durable architecture constrains it:

1. owner truth survives runtime/process restart where recoverability is required;
2. runtime snapshot without owner authority never authorizes continuation;
3. current authorization is rechecked on protected re-entry;
4. model spend survives restart/resume through owner facts;
5. external-effect ambiguity never becomes retry permission;
6. Release/Promotion history remains immutable and serving authority explicit;
7. Builder physical sandbox recreation never implies write-lineage continuity;
8. Mastra thread/trace continuity is not domain-run continuity;
9. missing required Evidence yields NOT_PROVEN, not reconstructed success;
10. restore cannot fabricate newer semantic truth than recovered owners establish;
11. migration recovery branch remains explicit after irreversible/maintenance transition;
12. current Plan/WorkUnit/ActorRun facts must be sufficient to settle interrupted Builder work without trusting session prose.

3M tests whether existing durable facts are sufficient without inventing a generic recovery engine.
