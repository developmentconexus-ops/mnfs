# 4B Evidence — Brain Schema Closure

> **Kind:** bounded 4B executable Evidence; not Product authority by itself.
> **Accepted semantic source:** current 4A Product authority plus accepted Brain/knowledge/data contracts.
> **Machine authority under proof:** `contracts/api/product/openapi.yaml` resolved graph.

## 1. Decision question

> Can the current Brain Product surface be given exact wire shapes without turning Brain into self-publishing memory, arbitrary SQL/text-to-SQL authority, or a new credential/data owner?

## 2. Exact Product slice

Current caller Product operations are exactly:

```text
BRN-01 → BRN-10
BRN-12
```

Total:

```text
11 Product operations
```

`BRN-11 RunBrainHealthProbe` remains absent from caller Product wire because current authority classifies it as `SYSTEM_OWNER_TRANSITION`.

Canonical active Path Items:

```text
contracts/api/product/brain-paths.yaml
```

They become authority only through the canonical `contracts/api/product/openapi.yaml` entrypoint and resolved bundle.

## 3. Closure laws proved

### 3.1 One Workspace Brain authority

`GetWorkspaceBrain` projects the canonical Workspace Brain publication state only. Brain does not absorb runtime conversation memory, vector/RAG indexes, tool authority, Permissions or Product authorization.

### 3.2 Published Brain revisions are immutable

Published Brain revision detail carries exact artifact/source identity:

```text
brainRevisionId
brainDigest
sourceRevision
availability = AVAILABLE
```

`AVAILABLE` does not mean live inheritance. Projects remain explicitly pinned to exact Brain revisions through Project-owned binding authority.

### 3.3 Discovery remains read-only and provenance-first

`StartBrainDiscovery` receives only the Project reference whose already-admitted source/Connection context is resolved server-side.

The request does not admit caller-selected:

```text
credential
secret
connectionString
sql
url / targetUrl
physicalTable
fullScan
```

Discovery candidates remain hypotheses bound to provenance. Unsupported mappings do not become canonical truth and no percentage accuracy is manufactured without measured Evidence.

### 3.4 KnowledgeProposal requires human review

KnowledgeProposal carries exact proposal/candidate/provenance coordinates. Its hypothesis/review states remain owner-issued strings because current Product authority does not ratify a lifecycle enum.

Submission cannot self-publish. Decision requires the exact current proposal revision plus:

```text
APPROVE | REJECT
```

Machine confidence never replaces current human review authority.

### 3.5 Publication creates a new immutable AVAILABLE revision

`PublishBrainRevision` names the exact reviewed candidate source revision and produces an immutable Brain revision. Publication does not silently rebind Projects or mutate existing revisions.

### 3.6 Health is an overlay, not content mutation

Brain health uses the accepted exact vocabulary:

```text
UNVERIFIED
VALID
SUSPECT
INVALID
CHECK_ERROR
```

The health projection carries the exact Brain revision/digest and `healthSnapshotDigest`. Critical health can block dependent use under current policy, but the overlay cannot rewrite immutable Brain content.

### 3.7 AnalyticQuery remains a restricted semantic query regime

`RunAnalyticQuery` is closed as:

```text
x-conexus-query-regime = ANALYTIC_QUERY_V0
x-conexus-sql-proof = SELECT_ONLY_REQUIRED
HTTP ingress = CONTROL_PLANE + PUBLISHED_APP
non-HTTP ingress = PAR_TOOL
```

Caller input is restricted to registered semantic authority:

```text
datasetSemanticId
selectSemanticIds[]
```

The wire rejects arbitrary SQL and physical topology authority such as:

```text
sql / rawSql
physical table/schema
caller-defined joins/join topology
connectionId
arbitrary expression
```

The response preserves exact Brain-plan, Project-binding and health-snapshot digests plus semantic columns/rows/provenance. It does not disclose SQL, physical storage topology or credentials.

## 4. Executable falsifiers

The Brain checker rejects at least:

```text
any current BRN Product operation not SCHEMA_CLOSED
BRN-11 appearing in caller Product wire
provisional Brain response authority
Brain memory/vector/tool/Permission ownership creep
mutable/live-inherited Brain revisions
Discovery credential/arbitrary-source/full-scan escape hatches
unsupported accuracy percentages or auto-canonical discovery output
KnowledgeProposal self-publish/machine-approval authority
invented proposal lifecycle enums
Brain health state vocabulary drift
health overlay mutation of immutable Brain content
AnalyticQuery arbitrary SQL/physical join/Connection authority
loss of SELECT-only proof law
loss of PAR_TOOL non-HTTP separation
```

Machine guard:

```text
scripts/check-wire-brain.mjs
```

## 5. TDD proof

```text
Verify #276 = FAILURE
→ expected RED before Brain schema activation
→ current BRN-01 remained METHOD_PATH_MAPPED/provisional while the new gate required SCHEMA_CLOSED

Verify #278 = SUCCESS
HEAD = 057094bbf4663a5350df1a43eff400e146d43881
```

Final established counts:

```text
fixed 4A operations      = 111
fixed OAS operations     = 111
schema-closed operations = 69
IAM + Workspace          = 20 / 20
Project                  = 21 / 21
Builder                  = 17 / 17
Brain Product            = 11 / 11
missing                  = 0
extra                    = 0
duplicate                = 0
literal IF_MATCH          = { PRJ-12, PAR-14 }
```

Budget Analyzer declaration/codegen/truth-state positive and negative controls remained part of the same successful full Verify.

## 6. Result

```text
IAM + Workspace = CLOSED inside 4B
Project         = CLOSED inside 4B
Builder         = CLOSED inside 4B
Brain           = CLOSED inside 4B
schema-closed   = 69 / 111
4B overall      = OPEN / ACTIVE
Product code    = BLOCKED
```

The next owner slice must continue compiling accepted authority into the same OAD. Missing semantics remain a falsifier/reopen trigger rather than permission to invent DTO meaning.
