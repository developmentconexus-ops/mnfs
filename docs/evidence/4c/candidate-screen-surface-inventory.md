# 4C — Candidate Screen / Material-Surface Inventory

> **Status:** CANDIDATE / 4C-5 / `4C-F02` COVERAGE RECOMPILED
> **Authority posture:** derived from the operator-accepted-for-progression 4C-4 candidate IA, the current 4C-0→4C-3 foundation and accepted Product authority. This document does not create Product operations, DTOs, authorization, runtime behavior, implementation authority or final visual structure.
> **Method:** `docs/development/frontend-product-experience-planning-method.md` v2.1 profiled by the Conexus 4C contract.

4C-5 answers one question only:

> Which candidate route/pages and material sub-surfaces are necessary to complete accepted human work without turning endpoint count, backend topology or visual convenience into screen authority?

4C-4 remains CANDIDATE and is not `LOCKED`. The later operator lock applies specifically to `GF-01 H1-R2`, not to the entire IA or this inventory.

At the original 4C-5 closure:

```text
4C-0→3 foundation                    = GREEN
4C-4 candidate IA                    = ACCEPTED FOR PROGRESSION / NOT LOCKED
4C-5 candidate screen inventory      = THIS DOCUMENT
4C-8 rendered structural wireframes  = NOT STARTED
4D Paved Road/runtime                = NOT STARTED
Product implementation               = BLOCKED
```

Later block work may recompile coverage when a valid upstream finding changes the operation set. `4C-F02` does exactly that: it adds `PRJ-23` to the already-existing Baseline-review surface rather than inventing another screen merely because the operation count changed.

---

## 1. Surface-splitting law

A Product operation does not imply a screen. Multiple operations may share one human surface when they serve one coherent job and preserve one semantic context.

A separate material surface is justified only when one or more change materially:

```text
primary semantic truth
safe user action
write owner
identity source
concurrency / idempotency behavior
content exactness / integrity
security / disclosure context
recovery path
viewer / editor mode
```

Recognized candidate surface kinds:

```text
ROUTE_PAGE
MATERIAL_REGION
DRAWER_MODAL
INLINE_COMPOSITION
ALTERNATE_VIEW
MATERIAL_STATE_VARIANT
APP_COMPOSED_SURFACE
```

Exact URL paths, component boundaries, responsive placement, visual density and reusable component APIs are not selected here.

## 2. Global Control Plane + Workspace candidate surfaces

| Surface ID | Candidate surface | Kind | Human job / truth | Material boundary / reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CP-S01 | Access & context frame | `INLINE_COMPOSITION` | know current authenticated Account/session and disclosable Workspace context; end session safely | global session/context truth; never owns grants |
| CP-S02 | First access / Workspace chooser | `ROUTE_PAGE` + bounded create modal | enter an authorized Workspace or create the trusted F1 Workspace when eligible | first-access recovery differs from normal Workspace work |
| CP-S03 | Trusted Account provisioning | `ROUTE_PAGE` / privileged internal surface | provision a known human Account at the trusted F1 operator boundary | platform-operator-only; not public signup |
| WS-S01 | Projects | `ROUTE_PAGE` | browse current disclosed Projects and start Project creation | primary Workspace work entry |
| WS-S02 | Project create / source-bootstrap flow | `ROUTE_PAGE` or `DRAWER_MODAL` candidate | establish one source-complete Project under an exact Workspace and continue to Inception | `PRJ-03` owns creation-time `NEW | EXISTING_GIT`; no second Repository/source-mutation domain |
| WS-S03 | Workspace Agent catalog | `ROUTE_PAGE` | browse accessible Project-owned Agents across Workspace | filtered projection only; never a fleet owner |
| WS-S04 | Workspace Brain overview | `ROUTE_PAGE` | inspect Brain identity, immutable revisions and health/provenance | Workspace semantic authority differs from Project binding |
| WS-S05 | Brain discovery + proposal review | `ROUTE_PAGE` with material review regions | run bounded discovery, inspect proposals, decide/publish reviewed meaning | machine-propose/human-decide and publication states |
| WS-S06 | Connections browse / detail | `ROUTE_PAGE` | browse Connector definitions, Connections, revisions and qualification truth | Connection lifecycle owner truth; ownerScope visible |
| WS-S07 | Connection create / revise | `MATERIAL_REGION` or `DRAWER_MODAL` candidate | establish or revise a Connection without changing its semantic owner | consequential/current-revision semantics differ from browse |
| WS-S08 | Connection credential entry | `MATERIAL_REGION` / secure form | set credential through write-only secret boundary | no secret readback |
| WS-S09 | Connection qualification | `MATERIAL_REGION` | run real-environment qualification and inspect result | proof operation, not generic Save/Test URL |
| WS-S10 | People & access | `ROUTE_PAGE` | administer Workspace membership, Areas and Project access | does not imply Published-App business access |
| WS-S10A | Workspace membership | `MATERIAL_REGION` | list/add/remove Workspace members | membership current-authority subject |
| WS-S10B | Areas + Area Project access | `MATERIAL_REGION` | list/create Areas and grant/revoke Area Project access | Area is grouping, not software owner |
| WS-S10C | Direct Account Project access | `MATERIAL_REGION` | grant/revoke exact Account access to exact Project | separate current-authority subject |
| WS-S11 | Audit inspection | `ROUTE_PAGE` + detail surface | inspect immutable Workspace/Project audit records | Evidence/provenance only; never current business state |

No generic Workspace `Settings` screen is created by symmetry. Current authority has no generic Workspace/Area metadata mutation after `4B-F01`.

---

## 3. Project candidate surfaces

| Surface ID | Candidate surface | Kind | Human job / truth | Material boundary / reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PRJ-S00 | Project context frame | `INLINE_COMPOSITION` | understand exact current Project context and disclosure | identity/context projection only; no generic metadata editor |
| PRJ-S01 | Project Inception / investigation | `ROUTE_PAGE` | supply current business intent, inspect objective/users/constraints/source reality and run bounded investigation | Journey B is not a fake Change; source admission already occurred at Project birth |
| PRJ-S02 | Candidate + approved Baseline review / decision | `MATERIAL_REGION` or focused route candidate | inspect exact candidate on first response or re-entry, distinguish it from current approved Baseline, approve only exact candidate subject | `PRJ-23` durable candidate read + `PRJ-08` approved read + `PRJ-09` exact decision; stale/candidate/current semantics justify one coherent Baseline block |
| PRJ-S03 | Build workspace | `ROUTE_PAGE` | state Change intent, inspect current Change/progress and keep build work centered | Hub truth, not model narration |
| PRJ-S04 | Plan + checkpoint review | `MATERIAL_REGION` | inspect exact Plan revision and make eligible checkpoint decision | decision/current-subject semantics |
| PRJ-S05 | Preview lens | `ALTERNATE_VIEW` | inspect last-good/current candidate Preview honestly | Preview ready != verified/live |
| PRJ-S06 | Code/source lens | `ALTERNATE_VIEW` | inspect exact source tree/file revision | source read authority differs from Build mutation |
| PRJ-S07 | Diff lens | `ALTERNATE_VIEW` | inspect exact candidate/result lineage | immutable/source lineage truth |
| PRJ-S08 | Findings + Evidence | `MATERIAL_REGION` / drawers candidate | inspect Findings/Evidence and close only with current resolution authority | review/provenance + exact decision |
| PRJ-S09 | Change execution detail | `MATERIAL_REGION` / detail drawer | inspect subordinate WorkUnit/ActorRun facts | progressive platform detail, not separate owner |
| PRJ-S10 | Contextual Conexus assistant | `INLINE_COMPOSITION` | ask about selected authorized Project context / next safe action | helper; grants no new authority |
| PRJ-S11 | Data | `ROUTE_PAGE` with master-detail candidate | inspect declared Product/read-model resources, grain, freshness, coverage and provenance | never generic DB explorer |
| PRJ-S12 | Analytic Query interaction | `MATERIAL_REGION` / `APP_COMPOSED_SURFACE` | ask governed semantic analytical questions over exact Brain/dataset scope | placement remains block-level question |
| PRJ-S13 | Capabilities | `ROUTE_PAGE` with detail candidate | inspect authored/Release Queries/Actions without gaining invocation by inspection | capability identity differs from source/integration mechanics |
| PRJ-S14 | Integrations / Project bindings | `ROUTE_PAGE` | inspect/set/remove exact ProjectConnectionBinding | binding differs from Connection lifecycle ownership |
| PRJ-S15 | Project-scoped Connections | `MATERIAL_REGION` inside external-system work | browse/manage private Project-owned Connection lifecycle separately from bindings | preserves Connection != Integration without duplicate top-level backend-shaped domain |
| PRJ-S16 | Agents | `ROUTE_PAGE` with detail candidate | inspect Project-owned authored Agent identity/revisions/Release state | authoring remains Change/Build |
| PRJ-S17 | Agent triggers | `MATERIAL_REGION` | inspect/create/revise/enable/disable schedule triggers | exact TriggerRevision/current-state laws |
| PRJ-S18 | Agent runs | `MATERIAL_REGION` | inspect AgentRun list/detail | runtime Evidence; COMPLETED != every effect succeeded |
| PRJ-S19 | Project Brain binding | `ROUTE_PAGE` / focused resource page | inspect/set/clear exact Brain revision binding and health context | binding owner differs from Workspace Brain publication |
| PRJ-S20 | Releases | `ROUTE_PAGE` with Release detail | inspect immutable Release composition, conformance and serving state | AVAILABLE != Promotion != served verification |
| PRJ-S21 | Promotion | `MATERIAL_REGION` / focused action surface | inspect history/current state and promote exact Release/environment | consequential current-pointer decision |
| PRJ-S22 | Activity | `ROUTE_PAGE` | browse activity entries pointing to owner facts | chronological projection only |
| PRJ-S23 | Execution observation detail | `MATERIAL_REGION` / detail drawer | inspect one typed execution observation | technical Evidence detail |
| PRJ-S24 | Usage & cost | `MATERIAL_REGION` | inspect usage/cost with provenance | missing != zero |
| PRJ-S25 | Effect attempts | `MATERIAL_REGION` / detail surface | inspect external effect attempt/reconciliation | no Retry/MarkSucceeded; OUTCOME_UNKNOWN explicit |
| PRJ-S26 | Managed jobs | `MATERIAL_REGION` | inspect JobRuns and trigger admitted run-now occurrence | not universal scheduler |
| PRJ-S27 | Project audit | `MATERIAL_REGION` | inspect audit records scoped to exact Project | governance Evidence distinct from Activity |
| PRJ-S28 | Exact ApprovalRequest | `MATERIAL_REGION` attached to exact AgentRun/context | list/inspect/decide only currently eligible exact subjects | no global Approval Center |
| PRJ-S29 | Project lifecycle management | `ROUTE_PAGE` / bounded management surface | archive or duplicate exact Project | no generic Project update; archive != unpublish/stop automations |
| PRJ-S30 | Published-App access administration | `MATERIAL_REGION` | list/set/revoke exact app access/role | app access independent from Workspace/Builder membership |

Project-scoped Connection lifecycle remains a distinct material surface inside Integrations work. If later operator walkthrough finds this harms findability, reopen only that terminology/placement decision.

---

## 4. Published Application candidate surface families

Published Applications do not inherit Control Plane navigation. Their exact business IA is Project-defined from the active Release and admitted app authority.

| Surface ID | Candidate surface | Kind | Human job / truth | Material boundary / reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PA-S01 | Published-App access/session frame | `INLINE_COMPOSITION` | establish current app access/role without Builder authority | independent app authorization |
| PA-S02 | Project-defined business / analytic surface | `APP_COMPOSED_SURFACE` | consume exact active-Release business capabilities | no generic execute UI |
| PA-S03 | Product Agent conversation | `APP_COMPOSED_SURFACE` | list/open/create Conversation and send turns to exact active Agent | exact Release/Agent pinning |
| PA-S04 | Agent run detail | `MATERIAL_REGION` | inspect exact AgentRun/receipts where admitted | runtime provenance differs from transcript |
| PA-S05 | Exact effect approval | `MATERIAL_REGION` attached to exact app/AgentRun context | decide exact sealed ApprovalRequest when route admits it | app role alone never confers approval eligibility |
| BUD-S01 | Budget Analyzer analysis dashboard | `ROUTE_PAGE` | run exact pending-budget analysis and understand truth state | no arbitrary metric/query builder |
| BUD-S02 | Pending budgets drilldown | `ROUTE_PAGE` or focused detail route | inspect exact pending-budget rows under response/page result coordinate | distinct row-level/paging truth |

---

## 5. Material state-variant obligations

| Surface family | Required material distinctions carried forward |
| --- | --- |
| Global/session | unauthenticated vs authenticated; denied vs absent/non-disclosable; session expiry/reauthentication |
| Project creation/Inception | NEW vs EXISTING_GIT source bootstrap; invalid/unavailable source fails without half-created Project; intent validation; candidate vs approved Baseline |
| Build | working vs blocked vs waiting-for-user vs completed; Hub truth vs model narration |
| Preview | last-good inspectable Preview vs next candidate building; ready vs verified vs live |
| Brain | inferred/proposed vs reviewed/published; UNVERIFIED/VALID/SUSPECT/INVALID/CHECK_ERROR |
| Connections | configured vs qualified vs bound vs healthy vs caller-authorized |
| Data/analytics/Budget | loading vs known-empty vs failed vs partial; SUPPORTED_CURRENT/STALE/PARTIAL/UNVERIFIED/UNSUPPORTED/DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE |
| Releases | candidate verified vs AVAILABLE vs Promotion approved vs pointer switched vs SERVED_VERIFIED |
| Agent/effects | AgentRun completed vs effect success; pending/denied/stale/expired; OUTCOME_UNKNOWN without blind replay |
| Usage/cost | reported/inferred/missing; calculated/provider/reconciled distinctions where available |

These are later Screen Contract/wireframe obligations, not client-owned lifecycle state machines.

## 6. Material-block ledger for later 4C cycles

| Block | Candidate scope | Why grouped | Reference / hypothesis trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GF-01` | global frame + Workspace/Project navigation | whole-product coherence checkpoint | now `LOCKED / H1-R2`; later blocks inherit it unless a material falsifier reopens it |
| `W-01` | Projects + source-complete create + Inception + candidate/approved Baseline | one continuous Journey-B entry/outcome | current active block; 4C-F02 corrected authority before structural work |
| `W-02` | Workspace Brain + Connections | reusable enterprise context/resources | separate sub-blocks if review vs secret/qualification semantics demand it |
| `W-03` | People/access + audit | governance/admin work | conventional unless complexity proves ambiguity |
| `W-04` | Workspace Agent catalog | access-filtered browse of Project-owned Agents | added after GF-01 Fable review so WS-S03 has an explicit proving block; not open |
| `P-01` | Build + Plan/Preview/Code/Diff/Findings/Evidence/assistant | primary Project workspace | reference study / competing hypotheses triggered |
| `P-02` | Data + Capabilities + Integrations + Project Connections + Brain binding | inspectable Product resources | AnalyticQuery placement and Connection findability explicit questions |
| `P-03` | Agents + triggers + runs + exact approvals | Product Agent lifecycle/runtime human work | approval discovery/placement trust-critical |
| `P-04` | Releases + Promotions + Activity + effect/job/usage/audit evidence | operate/inspect work | avoid deployment-dashboard flattening |
| `P-05` | bounded Project lifecycle + Published-App access administration | exact management actions only | no generic Settings symmetry |
| `PA-01` | Published-App platform frame + Product Agent surfaces | independent app authority | platform-owned boundaries stay minimal |
| `BUD-01` | Budget Analyzer dashboard + drilldown | first vertical/proving instance | dashboard→drilldown structural hypothesis |

## 8. Explicit no-screen / no-domain dispositions

```text
PAR-05 RunProductAgentHeadless
→ HEADLESS Product ingress
→ no direct browser UI consumer

universal Approval Center
→ REJECTED
→ exact ApprovalRequest surfaces remain contextual

universal workflow center / scheduler
→ REJECTED

screen-shaped Product operations = 0
parallel frontend Product DTO authority = 0
generic execute UI = 0
raw DB explorer = 0
global file manager = 0
provider/runtime console as Product authority = 0
```

A browser control that is navigation, projection, local view state or modal presentation does not gain a Product operation.

---

## 9. Findings / questions carried into block work

The original 4C-5 inventory exposed no upstream gap. W-01 later exposed `4C-F02`, now operator-accepted and being recompiled into this coverage. Structural questions remain bounded:

| ID | Candidate question | Next proving block |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `4C-S01` | exact global-frame navigation placement/order | `GF-01` — resolved by H1-R2 lock unless materially falsified |
| `4C-S02` | Project-scoped Connection lifecycle placement | `P-02` |
| `4C-S03` | Control Plane AnalyticQuery placement: Data-led vs Brain-led | `P-02` |
| `4C-S04` | exact ApprovalRequest host | `P-03` / `PA-01` |
| `4C-S05` | Budget drilldown route vs master-detail | `BUD-01` |
| `4C-S06` | discover pending exact ApprovalRequest without universal Approval Center or invented aggregate authority | `P-03`, cross-check `P-04` / `PA-01` |

`4C-A02` relative frequency/urgency remains open only where it materially affects ordering/density.

---

## 10. Candidate closure result after 4C-F02 coverage recompile

```text
frontend-reachable concrete operations expected = 113
frontend-reachable concrete operations mapped   = mechanically checked by repository test
PAR-05 browser surface                          = 0
invented user needs                             = 0
screen-shaped Product operations                = 0
parallel Product DTO authority                  = 0
4D selections                                   = 0
Product implementation                          = 0
```

This remains a **candidate inventory**, not a global structural lock. `GF-01` alone has subsequently been operator-locked. W-01 must complete its own authority-feasibility, reference/hypothesis, HTML P8 and operator-adjudication cycle before another block inherits W-01 structure.
