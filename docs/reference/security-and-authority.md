# Security and Authority

Current technical detail extracted without semantic rewriting from the accepted Phase-3 architecture baseline. `docs/architecture/index.md` owns the overview; this file owns the detailed task surface named by its title. The operator-approved C-015 Keycloak refinement is projected here without changing Product authorization ownership.

## 31. Security architecture — six logical trust zones

Zones are **security classifications, not mandated deployment units**.

## Z1 — Browser / Client

Authenticated or not, caller remains untrusted for authority-bearing fields. Client Project/Release/role/approval IDs are references/hints only and resolved server-side.

Control Plane, Preview and Published App browser contexts remain separate.

## Z2 — Trusted Hub Control

Trusted modular-monolith owners and co-located trusted control-side runtimes.

Module boundary is not intra-process RCE isolation. Full arbitrary trusted-Hub-process compromise remains an accepted F1 residual class; normal-path least privilege still limits avoidable blast radius.

## Z3 — Guest Execution

Current named guest = E2B Builder sandbox/app-under-test.

Root-capable/untrusted; gets bounded run/work capabilities only, no durable privileged credentials.

## Z4 — DEDICATED External Application

Authenticated external server-to-platform consumer under DEDICATED profile when a real consumer exists.

Its independently executable application may own its runtime/data plane and Product-specific network behavior. Conexus-owned capability access is explicit binding/Platform Service only; Gateway is that governed capability boundary, not the application's universal network stack. No Hub internals, Connection/Hub/Vault credentials or Project DB credentials are inherited. Physical DEDICATED deployment remains deferred until first real deployment.

## Z5 — External Provider / Enterprise

Model provider, E2B, Git provider, package registries, ERP/marketplace, backup targets, the selected Keycloak OIDC Identity Provider and similar systems.

A self-hosted/private Keycloak deployment remains logically a provider boundary even when physically co-located in the first-installation Linux guest. Authenticated/TLS provider response, including OIDC tokens/claims, is provider Evidence used by I&A; it never becomes Workspace/Project/Published-App/Product authorization merely by transport or claim presence.

## Z6 — Trusted Data / Storage Infrastructure

Logical storage zone containing:

```text
hub_control
Project databases
mastra_builder
mastra_par
Artifact/Blob/CAS backing
CredentialBackend backing
Keycloak provider persistence where self-hosted
backup material
```

Not one credential domain. Each store preserves owner/provider-specific capabilities/lifecycle. Keycloak persistence is authentication-provider state, not a fourteenth Hub owner schema and not a 47th Conexus durable record class.

---

## 32. Trust crossings and egress

## 32.1 Business/application egress

```text
Published/managed app capability
Product Agent business capability
Builder governed enterprise-data capability
→ Capability Gateway
→ exact Connection / Project-data executor
```

Generated app/browser/guest never bypasses Gateway to ERP/enterprise target.

## 32.2 Platform-control egress

Owner-specific infrastructure adapters may call exact providers without routing all control traffic through Gateway:

```text
I&A OIDC adapter → exact Keycloak issuer/client configuration
CodingRuntime → E2B
GitInfra → Git provider
Model adapter → model provider
backup operation → backup target
admitted build/package mechanics → pinned registry/catalog target
```

Every privileged adapter has a named owner, owner-specific credential and server-derived/pinned destination.

No universal privileged `fetch(url, secret)` service/egress proxy F1.

## 32.3 Browser egress

Browser self-only/CSP/session/request-authenticity laws are platform-controlled. The operator-approved C-015 refinement admits one bounded cross-origin authentication path: Conexus may redirect the browser to the exact configured Keycloak authorization endpoint and receive the allowlisted callback. This does not authorize arbitrary browser egress or make Keycloak claims Product authority.

Any other new cross-origin browser capability is explicit Product/security contract change, not app-config convenience.

## 32.4 Future SaaS ↔ private/on-prem reachability

C-003 preserves a real future requirement class:

```text
SaaS Conexus selected
+ enterprise target only reachable privately/on-prem
→ decide authenticated private reachability/custody topology
```

Current architecture does **not** preselect or deploy a managed tunnel F1. Mechanism is rederived from real SaaS/customer topology.

## 32.5 DEDICATED trusted exchange

The DEDICATED trust contract is current even though its physical deployment is deferred:

```text
principal              = DedicatedApplicationPrincipal
client authentication  = private_key_jwt
signed assertion binds = exact ReleaseRef
access token           = short-lived signed bearer
F1 mode                = SERVICE_SCOPED only
```

Every Platform Service request rechecks `credentialGeneration`, Project/Release containment, Release-pinned service composition and current owner/security gates. No auth record/session store, refresh-token, DPoP, mTLS or fleet machinery is introduced.

## 32.6 Human authentication — Keycloak OIDC boundary

C-015 now selects Keycloak as the human authentication mechanism while preserving Conexus I&A sovereignty:

```text
browser
→ Conexus login endpoint
→ exact Keycloak Authorization Code + PKCE S256 flow
→ Keycloak authenticates the human
→ server-side Conexus callback validates/exchanges the code
→ verified (issuer, subject) resolves one iam.account
→ Conexus issues its own opaque server-owned iam.session
→ every protected operation resolves current Conexus owner authority
```

The OIDC client is confidential/server-side. A library unable to support the required confidential-client flow is not admissible. Exact issuer, redirect URI, client identity and signing/validation expectations are pinned server-side. Implicit and resource-owner-password/direct-grant browser login are not admitted.

Keycloak realm/client roles, groups, organizations and Authorization Services remain provider-side mechanics and MUST NOT substitute for Workspace membership, Project grants, Published App access, Release eligibility, Connection-use authority or another Conexus owner fact.

---

## 34. Published Application access and private storage

## 34.1 Independent app authorization

```text
CONTROL_PLANE
!= PREVIEW
!= PUBLISHED_APP
```

Current closed F1 Published App role set:

```text
{admin, member}
```

until explicit later material Product decision changes it.

```text
Project admin -X-> app admin automatically
app member    -X-> Builder/source access automatically
```

Published App authorization is server-derived; frontend is not enforcement authority.

## 34.2 Session boundary

Current C-015 direction uses Keycloak only to establish authenticated human identity through OIDC. Conexus maps verified `(issuer, subject)` to its own Account and creates an opaque server-owned application session/cookie. Historical URL-fragment bearer flow is not current authority, and browser possession of a Keycloak token never grants Conexus Product authority by itself.

## 34.3 Private-by-default bytes

Attachments/blobs are private by default:

```text
owner record/current authorization
→ access decision
→ storage byte retrieval
```

Published Application serving is also caller-reachable byte retrieval. Possession or guessing of an asset/CAS/storage path never bypasses the current serving/app authorization policy. Public/pre-auth exposure, if ever admitted for a bounded login shell, must be explicit and contain no protected business data.

Public exposure requires explicit admitted Product policy/consumer. Storage key/path/prefix/provider URL never grants semantic access by possession alone.

## 34.4 Disaster-restore authority

A disaster restore may reintroduce a control generation older than the last pre-failure authority decisions. A restored mutable grant/session/approval/trigger/credential fact is therefore historical as-of-cutoff when a later narrowing or revocation may have been lost; the restored value does not become current merely because it exists.

Before normal ingress, autonomous execution or effectful use is re-enabled:

```text
restored normal sessions
→ invalid for normal reuse

material privileged/autonomous/effectful authority
→ re-established/recertified through the existing owning module
→ current owner checks apply again before protected use
```

Because Keycloak is now a required authentication provider, first-production recovery must also establish continuity of the configured issuer/provider generation and the stable `(issuer, subject)` identities referenced by `iam.account`. Restoring or rebuilding an IdP must never silently remap an existing Conexus Account to a different human. Unknown identity continuity keeps normal human login/use fail-closed until explicitly reconciled through I&A.

The exact closed set of authority classes that require recertification is fixed in Realization Planning and proven in the first-production restore drill. This is an operational recovery rule, not a new authorization domain.

The infrastructure recovery posture is deny-only. It may prevent normal ingress/autonomy, but neither its presence nor its clearing grants Product authority. Any future realization that requires a composite Hub-side recovery-activation grant is an L7/owner Decision Loop trigger.
